# Roman number to decimal exercise

[Link to this exercise in leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/). You can run the [Original code](originalRomanToInteger.js) if you want to try and have the same time as I did or you can run the [Humanized code](humanizedRomanToInteger.js) if you only want to see the algo running in a visually manner.

# Method

Basically I've used only object literals and conditional expressions in this exercise.

How to use object literals:

```
const literal = { // Top level object
    "name": "Henrique",
    "address": { // sub literal
        "Street": "Highway 66",
    }
}

console.log(literal["name"]); // Should print 'Henrique';
console.log(literal.address["street"]) // Should print 'Highway 66'
```
